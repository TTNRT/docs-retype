Is there a guide to do so?","A: See our quick start guide in this group.","Q: Is this service going to have usage payed to my account?","A: No. In fact, this service is free for anyone to use or test out with.","Q: If I use the Woodpecker CI service to push my changes, will that take away usage or have a payment on it?","A: As part of our CI usage agreement, you'll still be charged to your account based on what you are using with the Woodpecker CI.","Q: Is custom domains available?","A: We haven't tested that at this time. For now, you should use our pages domain until this feature is available."]}],[{"l":"Quick start"},{"l":"Preparing your repository","p":["For the use of Meli pages, you should have the following below:","Access to the Woodpecker Ci service","A repo with static files (can be from a generator, if possible)"]},{"l":"Creating your site","p":["Head over to the Meli site: https://meli.ttnrtsite.me.

Create it using the image below.","After you created your site, create a branch named anything you want. Once done, you should keep note on your token created for you. The token is located in the \"Tokens\" tab. The name will be \"first token\". Copy your token, as you will need it for uploading your site. You should also have your site id as well. You can find it by clicking on the \"How to upload\" button inside your branch.","Don't share your token with anyone! For your security, you should keep it in a safe place to keep it out from others!"]},{"l":"Uploading your files","p":["Since Meli comes with a cli system that doesn't really use the actions system, we came up with two methods to push your site to the system.","Using the Woodpecker CI (faster)","Using a local computer (easier, but more differnet)"]},{"l":"Using the woodpecker CI","p":["Make sure you have access to the CI interface. If not, give us an email and we will grant you access to the service.","You should already have a repo created with your static files pushed it. To start off, create a file inside the root folder. The name should be like this: .woopeckerci.yml","Once you created this file, you can add your commands needed to push your files to Meli. Below is an example of what it would look like.","You need to replace the following below","<reponame> with your repo name","<username> with your account username","<folder> with your folder of choice","<site_id> with your site id you copied earlier.","<token> with your token you also copied earlier","Once you made your changes, commit them to your repo.

You can Google on how to do that.","For uploading your site, you need to have a folder with your static site data inside. Open a command line session where your static data is located. If you click on the \"How to upload\" button, you will get a command to upload your files. The command will look like this.","Note that your site id is already put in for you.

Make sure you are not overwriting anything on the remote end before you force push local git folder to it using. You can fix it using this flag with your push command. It would look like this.","If you also want to add a branch without the need of using the push command while committing your changes, you can use this command below, which will allow you to checkout your changes without the need of using the -u part of the git command.

To download it to your computer, click this to get your runner file. Keep in mind that you need to specify your Operating System you are using. In this case, we will choose the Linux version.","In case if you are using the Linux version, make sure you pick the correct architecture based on your system processer. For example, if your system is a Raspberry Pi, choose the ARM version. Otherwise, pick the AMD64 version. This also goes if you are using a Apple device.","It is recommended to download the latest version of the runner executable. Download your runner file to any location of your choosing.","Since the executable is marked as non-executable, you should use the chmod command (if using linux) to allow it to run correctly!

Your account is linked to whatever account you made and is supposed to be that way as long as it should.","A: TTNRT ID is running on Keycloak as it's base framework and the service is located on US East.","A: We haven't looked into that as of now. However, your account is linked to that account you created on the database and what service your using with it.","A: Yes it is. Your account will still be accessible through the sign-in portal as it should.","A: Yes you should! Git clients don't support the use of OAuth or OpenID connect with external providers, so you should add a username and password when linking. This is important if you are using Git-scm for pushing, pulling or committing changes to your repo. You should also add an email after creating if needed.","A: Yes you should! When signing up for our services, your account doesn't match what you post to the database. As a workaround, you should consider having the same email, username and password in case you need your password if your client or application uses that.","A: Yes you should.","A: You should report them to our support email right away if you are having issues with the system.","Q: How can I report issues if the system is not working for me or is having issues?","Q: If I delete my account on TTNRT ID, what will happen to my login for the service I'm using it for?","Q: If I get my account removed or delete it, will TTGit or any other service that relys on TTNRT ID remove it from their database?","Q: If I'm going to add a account with this system on TTGit, is it okay and safe for me to add a password along with a username? With the Git client as well?","Q: If I'm going to use TTNRT ID with my services, should I use the same email, username, and password for that service I'm using?","Q: Is it safe to link my current account with the ID system?","Q: What is TTNRT ID running on and what site is it on?","Q: When I change my password on the ID system, should I also change on the service as well if it doesn't update it automatically?","Q: Will all services use this system as part of the safety plan in place?","We know that people like to ask us questions about our new services. Here are some questions that you might ask about using TTNRT ID."]}],[{"l":"Introduction","p":["TTNRT ID is a identification system for login and register with the exception of extra security being applied to the users account. It was introduced in early April and was released to the public later on during the month.
